Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency Based on Age and Skin Color

## About

This project was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Maryam Habibi as part of the "Fundamentals and Computational Intelligence" course at Azad University of Kermanshah in 1401. The objective of the project was to explore the prevention of vitamin D deficiency with a focus on age and skin color as key variables. By utilizing specific rules and logical reasoning, as well as drawing insights from credible sources such as the Mayo Clinic article and other relevant studies, we were able to determine recommended exposure times to sunlight for different demographic groups.

## Inputs and Methodology

The inputs for this project included environmental temperature, skin color, and age of individuals. We developed a comprehensive methodology that considered these factors in correlation with the required amount of vitamin D. Through the integration of specific rules and data analysis, we derived valuable insights that can contribute to the prevention of vitamin D deficiency.

## Key Findings

Based on our research, we established varying exposure recommendations for different age groups and skin colors. For individuals up to 12 months, the recommended duration is 40 seconds per day, for individuals aged 1 to 70 years, it is 60 seconds per day, and for individuals over 70 years, it is 80 seconds per day. Furthermore, we highlighted the importance of extended sunlight exposure for individuals with darker skin tones to facilitate adequate vitamin D production.

## Significance and Impact

The findings of this project hold crucial implications for public health measures, emphasizing the significance of managing vitamin D levels across different demographic groups. By shedding light on the relationship between age, skin color, and recommended sunlight exposure, we aim to contribute to improved preventive healthcare practices and overall community well-being.
